    <h2>My name is Jaime Luy</h2>
<div class="intro">
    <p>I am currently attending Santa Ana High school as a sophomore.
I am (as I'm writing this) 15 years old. In 8th grade, I took an intro class to Computer Science.
In my freshman year, I took Introduction to Engineering Design (IED)
and made multiple projects.</p>

  <p>As I was growing up, I developed an interest in video games. Ever since I was in 3rd
  grade, video games (exponentially) became a part of my life. One of the first
  games I played was <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, along with other games on Nintendo's <i>Gamecube</i>.
  Over time I have played more and more, especially once I reached 8th grade, probably my
  "golden age" of playing video games, as my brother had decided it was time for
  me to play more mature games (such as <i>Dead Space</i> or <i>Wolfenstein: The First Order</i>).
  Funnily enough, I may have been actively playing video games for a majority of my free time,
  but my grades have never been affected. People think video games are bad for school,
but in the end it's hw one manages their time that really sets the outcome. Anyways,
 this is what led to me wanting to become an engineer. I have always wondered
  (when I was younger) how video games worked.</p>

<div class="computer">
  <p>Truthfully speaking, I am not sure of what I want to be when I grow up. I am
  not sure if I want to something in computer engineering or something else like
mechanical engineering. I am currently debating which would be better, however I am leaning
more towards computers since I am somewhat familiar with them. I also enjoy
computers, as they seem to have many possiblities in and out of the workplace.
And yes, I use a computer to perform recreational activities as well, mostly to
 play video games or watch some videos from time to time. Maybe something in
video game design might be nice, or maybe just being a coder for video games
(not actually designing in-game models, but rather code the game's mechanics and "how things work
" in the game).</p>
